I've decided to set up a blog. It's been a while since I've had an outlet for my
ramblings. Back when I was a student at the University of Oslo I used to run my
own website on the now-defunct [folk.uio.no](https://folk.uio.no), but that site
went dark years ago.

This site is a static site generated with a tool called
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It allows me to write these posts in markdown
and compile it to a set of static HTML pages that can be hosted anywhere, which
is quite convenient. I've used Jekyll for a few different projects in the past,
and always found it to be quite good to work with. It also integrates well with
GitHub which is nice.
