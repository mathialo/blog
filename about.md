My name is Mathias, and I'm a software engineer in Oslo, Norway. I currently
work for a company called [Cognite](https://www.cognite.com/), though everything
I write here are my own thoughts.

I hold a bachelors and masters degree in applied mathematics from the University
of Oslo, and my academic work mostly focused on image processing, compressive
sensing and machine learning. I have also been a part time guitarist and drummer
around Oslo for the past decade, so expect to see some writing about music here
as well from time to time.
